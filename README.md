# Project-3-CS-210
Final Project SNHU CS 210


Project Summary

The Corner Grocer project was created to help a small grocery store track how often each item is purchased. The program reads a text file that lists all the items bought during the day, counts how many times each item appears, and then displays the results on the screen and saves them in a file. This project was meant to solve the problem of doing inventory tracking by hand, which can be slow and inaccurate. Automating this process makes it easier for the store to see what sells the most and manage inventory better.

What I Did Well

I wrote code that is clear, organized, and easy to read. I made sure to use consistent formatting, meaningful variable names, and helpful comments so that anyone reviewing it can understand what each part does. I also focused on making sure the logic was correct and that the program handled user input smoothly. I was proud of how efficiently the program reads and processes data from the file.

Areas for Enhancement

If I were to improve the project, I would add more error checking to handle situations like missing files or bad data. I could also allow the user to choose which file to read instead of using a fixed file name. These changes would make the program more flexible and reliable. I might also look into improving performance when working with larger datasets by optimizing how the program stores and retrieves data.

Challenges and Solutions

The hardest part of the project was getting the file input and frequency counting logic to work correctly. At first, I had trouble making sure the program read every line properly and counted items accurately. To solve this, I broke the problem into smaller steps and tested each one as I went. I also used resources like the course textbook, examples, and debugging tools to identify where the logic needed fixing.

Transferable Skills

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of C++ concepts like loops, functions, and file input and output. I also improved at debugging and problem solving, which are useful skills for any programming work. Working on this project helped me get more comfortable using GitHub for version control and organizing code for future use. These skills will carry over to future classes and software projects.

Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability

I focused on writing code that would be easy to maintain and adapt in the future. Each function has a clear purpose, and the program is structured so that new features can be added without changing the main logic. The comments explain what the program does and why certain steps are needed. This makes it easier for someone else to understand and build on the code later on.
